# TransposedDirectFormIIFilter
First attempt at creating an audio/DSP filter using the JUCE C++ library/framework.
I started with a Biquad Transposed Direct Form II filter because it's easy to implement
and will help me understand how to process audio in C++ and JUCE. 

The source code for the filter is from the site listed below and will implement the 
algorithm there in my JUCE plugin structure. I will also create a very simple GUI to 
control the filter's cutoff frequency, Q, and peak gain.
